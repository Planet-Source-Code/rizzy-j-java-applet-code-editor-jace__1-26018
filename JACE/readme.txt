Instructions for setting up JACE

1)	Copy the two DOS batch files 'jdisasm.bat' and 'runapplet.bat' into the C:\
2)	Run the VB project JACE.vbp
3)	Make sure the text file 'tipofday.txt' exists in the same folder as the VB project and forms

Improvements

1)	The select all command does not work, needs implementing
2)	Documents cannot be printed
3)	Compiling, running and disassembling Java applications and applets can be improved.
4)	Closing child forms.
5)	Any other things that I have missed.
